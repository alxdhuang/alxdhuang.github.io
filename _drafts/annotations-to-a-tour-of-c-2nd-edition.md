[*A Tour of C++*, 2nd Edition](http://www.stroustrup.com/tour2.html) (2018) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

{% include toc.html %}

## Preface

> This book gives an overview of C++ as defined by [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17), the current ISO C++ standard, and implemented by the major C++ suppliers. In addition, it mentions **concepts** and **modules**, as defined in ISO Technical Specifications and in current use, but not scheduled for inclusion into the standard until [C++20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20).

It is the father of C++, he can talk about the content that has not been released yet, and he is more standard than the standard!

> This thin book aims to give an experienced programmer an idea of what constitutes modern C++.

The target readers.

> This book can be read in just a few hours but, obviously, there is much more to writing good C++ than can be learned in a day. However, the aim here is not mastery, but to give an overview, to give key examples, and to help a programmer get started.

So what's the next step after having a finish to read this book? Maybe *C++ Primer* and *The C++ Programming Language*.

Live with C++ for years.

> More advice about what constitutes good modern C++ can be found in the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines).

## 1. The Basics

### 1.4 Types, Variables, and Arithmetic

#### 1.4.2 Initialization

> The `=` form is traditional and dates back to C, but if in doubt, use the general `{}`-list form.

It's always true to use `{}`-list to initialize a variable.

## 2. User-Defined Types
