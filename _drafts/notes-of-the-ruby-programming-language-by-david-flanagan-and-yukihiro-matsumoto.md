> Ruby is a dynamic programming language with a **complex** but **expressive** grammar and a core class library with a rich and powerful API. Ruby draws inspiration from Lisp, Smalltalk, and Perl, but uses a grammar that is easy for C and Java<sup>TM</sup> programmers to learn. Ruby is a pure object-oriented language, but it is also suitable for procedural and functional programming styles. It includes powerful metaprogramming capabilities and can be used to create domain-specific languages or DSLs.

Ruby is a *completely* object-oriented language. That means every value in Ruby is an object, i.e. it has methods. Parentheses in method invocations are commonly omitted, that make it more readable.
