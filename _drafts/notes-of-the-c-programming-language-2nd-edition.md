## Quotes

> C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.

> C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application.

> Most of the treatment is based on reading, writing and revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the most part, the  examples are complete, real programs, rather than isolated fragments.
