Some notes of [*Coders at Work*]() written by [Peter Seibel]() (2009).

> This book takes a different approach to getting at what programming is, following in the tradition established when the literary journal *The Paris Review* sent two professors to interview the novelist E.M. Forster, the first in a series of Q&A interviews later collected in the book *Writers at Work*.

> I asked these folks about programming: how they learned to do it, what theyâ€™ve discovered along the way, and what they think about its future. More particularly, I tried to get them to talk about the issues that programmers wrestle with all the time: How should we design software? What role do programming languages play in helping us be productive or avoid errors? Are there ways we can make it easier to track down hard-to-find bugs?
