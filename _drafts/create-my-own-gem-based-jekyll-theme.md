I want to customize the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. How don't I just clone the repository and integrate it into my project? Because that way is not easy to maintain. I would very difficult to keep track of the new progress of Minima project. A better way is forking the Minima project and modify it, then use the new theme in my blog site.
