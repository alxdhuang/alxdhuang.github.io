I need a way to [take notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking) and to keep track of what I have done over time. I want my notes alive in the [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) format, which has [great power](http://wiki.c2.com/?PowerOfPlainText) (easier to view, maintain, and share).

Of course, I can create a repository on the [GitHub](https://github.com) and put all notes in it. However, by comparing with that way, I discover that writing a blog on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) has many benefits.

1. **Freedom**

    Writing on a personal blog site have more freedom comparing with writing on GitHub Markdown. You can customize the look of your site and use a third-party plugin, e.g. [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

2. **Organization**

    Blogs can be archived by categories or tags. It's more flexible than a static folders tree.
