### 1.1 About Version Control

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

- **Local Version Control Systems**. VCSs have a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. For example, [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System)(Revision Control System).
