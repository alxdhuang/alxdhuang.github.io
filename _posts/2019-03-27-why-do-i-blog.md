I need a way to [take notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking) and to keep track of what I have done over time. I want my notes alive in the [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) format, which has [great power](http://wiki.c2.com/?PowerOfPlainText) (easier to view, maintain, and share).

Of course, I can create a repository on the [GitHub](https://github.com) and put all notes in it. However, by comparing with that way, I discover that writing a blog on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) has many benefits.

1. **Freedom**

    Writing on a personal blog site have more freedom comparing with writing on GitHub Markdown. You can customize the look of your site and use a third-party plugin, e.g. [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

2. **Organization**

    Posts can be archived by categories or tags. It's more flexible than a static folders tree.

3. **Social**

    You can implement or integrate a [comment system](https://medium.com/level-up-web/most-popular-3rd-party-comment-systems-for-your-website-9f4329a4c6bf) in your blog. [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com) even said that [*A Blog Without Comments Is Not a Blog*](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/).

4. **Business**

    Many guys said that [blog can earn money](https://www.bloggingbasics101.com/how-can-i-make-money-from-my-blog/). I don't know how to do that yet, but let's try it.
